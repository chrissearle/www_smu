Today's flights were just practicing controls - round and round in circles trying to get smoother at lining up shots etc.

No video - it would be _extremely_ boring - but the following flight logs:

* <%= flytrex_i1('Nui4sdo2', 'First flight') %>
* <%= flytrex_i1('8fyufZKX', 'Second flight') %>
* <%= flytrex_i1('ZoHRMP9K', 'Third flight') %>
