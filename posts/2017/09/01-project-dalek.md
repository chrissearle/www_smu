intro: So - you want to build a dalek - where to get information?
---

Did some digging - and have found several voice modulators for arduino out there that can make you sound like you're a dalek. Some of them also do the lights control. Some mention the [wave arduino shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/94) from adafruit as a useful addition.

Didn't find exactly what I want (I'm more interested in one that can take playback rather than a microphone) but I did find that lots of things link to [Project Dalek](http://www.projectdalek.com/) - looks like a really useful resource.
