intro: Printing progress. Lots more parts printed.

Printing progress. Lots more parts printed. I have run out of blue so some are red. I've also run out of red - so the skirts will be in black. All that leaves now is the ears - they need to be in clear - and I need to get some clear filament for those (they will not be painted and need to have LEDs inside).

## The neck

First up is the neck.

This is built up of three rings, four inside inserts and 8 slats that the rings sit on.

</figure>

The assembly here is that the inserts go inside the rings, the rings are glued to the small stubs on the slats.

Here's a picture with only the bottom ring in place to give an idea.

## Random parts

With the last of the blue - some random parts.

From the top left:

- the globe shape is the pivot for the arm where it goes inside the shoulder
- the thin square and thin circle are decals to go onto the shoulder part where the arms come out
- the thick round part is the pivot for the eye
- the big part bottom left is the bottom of the gun
- the small circle bottom middle is part of the tip of the gun
- the small circle bottom right goes right behind the plunger on the arm.

Now we switch to the red - to get the plunger end and the eye (two parts).

## Shoulders

Now we switch to the red. The shoulders hold the arm/gun and also have some slats on the outside for design.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">A closer look at the arm holes</figcaption>
</figure>

They are standing on their ends - not easy to get good bed adhesion - so this is the first time I've used a brim instead of a skirt (a raft seemed overkill). They all held in place - so that worked.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">The shoulder slats on the build plate with brim</figcaption>
</figure>

## The dome

Finally - we have the dome. This has two parts so far - the dome itself and the cowl.

I'm not happy with the cowl - it has no flat face to put onto the build plate - and even though it printed OK with supports - the corners are not great. I may either do a larger filling/sanding job here - or I might cut it into smaller parts in meshmixer and print/glue them. Not sure yet.

## Still to do

### Parts

Currently the skirts are printing (in black). I still need to do the light holders (ears?) - but for that I need to get some transparent filament. Finally I need to do the metal rods (eye, gun, arm) - not sure what to use for that yet - as well as the transparent rings halfway along the eye rod.

### Painting

The entire thing needs filling, sanding, primer and painting - I will be using something similar to [this colour scheme](http://www.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/dalek/types/19-time-war-daleks/).

### Assembly

Glue. Superglue. Hopefully not too much on my fingers.

### After that?

LEDs for the lights - synced to flash with sound and a dim blue led in the eye.
