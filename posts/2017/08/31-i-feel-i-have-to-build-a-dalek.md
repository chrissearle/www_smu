While I was digging for some inspiration for a new 3d model I happened across the [Accurate Dalek Model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:369866) by user [Audrey2](https://www.thingiverse.com/Audrey2/about).

This brings back memories of being terrified as a kid by these fantastic things - and I feel the urge to build one.

I've worked out that I can scale to 200% - the largest footprint are the two base parts - and 200% just fits on the build plate.

So - to do this it's going to take a fair bit of printing, a lot of priming and sanding and then painting.

- Can I add some LEDs to get the eye light and the ears to flash?
- Can I add sound?

Let's see where this goes.

Stay tuned ...
