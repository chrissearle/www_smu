intro: Back in 2011 - we found a guillemot on the lawn. Today - it happened again.

Way back in September 2011 we came home to find [a guillemot on the lawn](/2011/09/16/it-s-friday-afternoon-and-you-have-a-guillemot-on-your-lawn/)

These are seabirds who can only take off from water. They sometimes get confused and land on roads thinking that they are streams.

So - we captured the bird and I took it to a local lake (Sognsvann).

This morning - we had *another* guillemot outside the house.

This one got released onto the fjord near to the opera house.
