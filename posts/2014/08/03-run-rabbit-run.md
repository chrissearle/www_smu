intro: Building the rabbit run frame
---

We recently took over two female angora rabbits - while we were on holiday, they've had two weeks at the summer hut. Now we're back home and will need to leave them unattended - they need a run.

On Thursday evening I took a trip to Maxbo and purchased the wood (untreated in case the rabbits gnaw on it) and some plastic roofing plates - colour is called soot - hopefully it will provide some shade while still letting some light in.

On Friday - we started with building the frame:

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Roof added</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Roof added</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Door in place</figcaption>
</figure>

The white box in the background is for garden chair cushions but it's neither waterproof or mouse proof - so we're repurposing it as a bedroom for the rabbits. It will be joined with a short tunnel and can be properly insulated for winter - something the hutch can't be.

I'd intended to have enough netting in from the base to prevent the rabbits from digging out - but on Thursday evening while I was sitting in the garden a badger came round the corner of the garage. They're excellent diggers - so we needed a more robust base. But I didn't want the rabbits to have to sit on the wire mesh.

So the next stage was removing the turf:

</figure>

Now - finding fox proof netting turned out to be hard. In the end - we found a website for a firm based in Ramnes (near TÃ¸nsberg) [D. Johansen Husdyrutstyr](http://www.djohansenhusdyrutstyr.no/) who had galvanised netting with a 1" square grid - 1.2m high, 25m long and with 1,75mm thick wire. To top it off - they were doing a free delivery run around the region on Sunday. Perfect size, grid, thickness and timing.

Big heavy roll though.

Now we had to finish the ground preparation.

<figure class="figure w-100 text-center">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Turf replaced. You can also see the door added to the white box in the background</figcaption>
</figure>

Next the frame was moved back into place and the netting along the bottom fastened to it.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Frame placed inside ground grid</figcaption>
</figure>

Now came the walls.

<figure class="figure w-100 text-center">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Start of hanging the wall netting</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure class="figure w-100 text-center">

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Wall netting in progress from the inside</figcaption>
</figure>

So - we got the walls and door done.

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Walls and door complete</figcaption>

  <figcaption class="figure-caption">Not a rabbit</figcaption>
</figure>

And finally we moved the rabbits in.

</div>

What's left to do now? Well - we still need to make the tunnel to the white box/bedroom, add a hook in the inside of the door so that you can keep the door closed while inside - but otherwise - pretty much done.
