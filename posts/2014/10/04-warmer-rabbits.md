Finally got hold of the insulation for the rabbits bedroom.

It's 5cm thick expanded polystyrene. For now that's enough.

I have fitted a special low voltage heater that will keep the area between 12C and 15C - but we don't need that until later - and I'll only turn it on once I have temperature monitoring in place too.

The floor is waterproofed with damp-proofing membrane (since I have a roll lying around) - on top of that will go a layer of newspapers then straw.
