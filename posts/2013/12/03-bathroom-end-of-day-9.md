The floor had obviously dried enough for them to work.

Progress today:

- Old ceiling removed - prepared for the downlights
- Cable pull tubes installed
- Door between the bathroom and bedroom removed (this will become a wall containing the pipe-in-pipe inspection box)
- Some pipe-in-pipe outer tubes and manifolds installed
- End wall inner panel (chipboard or similar) mounted (around window)
