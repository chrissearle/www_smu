Bath tiled (grouting still to come).

Sink mounted (and plumbed).

Radiator plumbed in.

Electrics done. Lights, warmth etc all working.

The only issue today was that when the plumber looked at the shower he'd fetched - it was one for a shower cubicle (in other words no way to fill the bath). He's going to go get the right one tomorrow (cross fingers that it's in stock).
