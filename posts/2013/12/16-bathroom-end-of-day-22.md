Grouting and silicone done.

First two pics are pre-silicon with the grouting drying so look washed in grey. The last three are afterwards with most of the grout dust removed and the silicone in place.

Tomorrow (Tuesday) is the bath and the sink (not entirely sure about the sink - might need to wait with that until the bath is in place and tiled in).

Wednesday is the electrician. Probably the backside of the door that used to go thru to the bedroom too.

Left to do will be the window (including the tiles around it) which is waiting on a new window due early new year. Takes at least 6 weeks to make a window apparently.
