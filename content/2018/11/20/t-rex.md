intro: Everyone needs an 80cm long Tyrannosaurus Rex
---

Most of the 3d printing I am interested in is functional prints. However - sometimes a model
sticks out as something really worth printing.

The [MakerBot T-Rex skeleton ](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:275091) is one such.

For ease of printing - I went with [this remix](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2314156) printed at 130%
scale.

For the ribs - you can choose either each rib in turn standing - or a complete set printed laying on the plate - with supports.

The standing single ribs I was finding hard to slice in slic3r prusa edition - some thin walls that needed me to turn off single wall detection, but - still left gaps. So I went with the complete set with supports. This printed well - but - the bits that clip into the holes in the spine were too thin. So I removed them and used CA glue to fix to the spine protrusions just above each hole instead.

Scale - the model is about 80 cm (31.5") teeth to tail and 32 cm (12,5") from the base to the top of the upper hip bone.
