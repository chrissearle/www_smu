intro: Covid causes more deliveries - but they keep going to the wrong door. Let's make a door nameplate to help them.
---

In the current situation - there has been an increase in the number of things delivered rather than heading to the shops.

Being a building with two flats - and two doors - but just one house number - there's been a fair bit of confusion and stuff delivered to the wrong flat.

So - time for a name plate for the door.

The house is from 1932 - so - we took a look at other signs from the same period and landed on one with a nice thin font ([Poirot One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poiret+One)) and bars/corner boxes.

## Woodworking

So - first up - make the backing board. This is a piece of 6mm ply - cut to size and sanded smooth on one side.

Second - the frame to hold it to the door - these are made from old cut off pieces of pallet wood - jointed, planed and routed - to give a rebate along the inner edge to take the board and chamfered on top edges.

## Design/Lettering

So - how to do the lettering?

Step 1 - three coats of a spray white lightly sanded after the first and second coat.

Step 2 - design the layout in a combination of Illustrator and Fusion 360 - getting the result as SVG.

Step 3 - cut out the design on a silhouette cameo 4 cutter using stencil material - a sticky back thick vinyl/plastic and then attach this to the white painted side. Mask off anything outside with tape. Make sure all edges are tightly pressed down.

Step 4 - three coats of a spray black

Step 5 - very very carefully - remove the stencil - hoping all the while that nothing has got under the edges. That was a bit nervewracking.

## Results

These shots show the results after peeling the stencil.

## Next steps

Three more things to do:

* A coat or two of a clear top layer to protect the thin black paint from damage
* Paint and cut the frame and cut the excess off the board away (equal amount of white space on all four sides)
* Mount it
