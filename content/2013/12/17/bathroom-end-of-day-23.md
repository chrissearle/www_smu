Bath in place and boxed in. Tiling still to do. The room look a lot smaller now - almost back to the size it was when we started :) But the bath is 20cm longer and wider than the old one. Something that the kids are looking forward to using.

New radiator mounted but not plumbed in yet.

Work started on the bedroom side of the blocked off door.

The window we're waiting for may delay the fitting of the sink it seems - since it can't be fully mounted until the tiling above is done. Shame that a window takes 6 weeks when you're otherwise on a four week project.

We'll see what happens tomorrow.
