Bath grouted (silicone tomorrow).

Shower mounted.

Doorframe refitted, first coat of paint on frame and door.

Tomorrow:

- Door - second coat and silicon between frame and tiles

Waiting on the new window and the towel cupboard - both have a delivery mid January. Glass shower panel will be fitted about the same time between the bath and the sink (has to wait on the window).
