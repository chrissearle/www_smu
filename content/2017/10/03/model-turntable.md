intro: Turntable for working on painting/airbrushing models
---

When working on some models (both kit and 3d printed) it helps to have a turntable to get access all around without having to touch the model. Ths helps when building, painting and especially when airbrushing.

I found [this design on thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1662153) but it wasn't quite what I wanted - a bit too small and needs to be screwed together. I wanted a larger plate and everything to be a press fit.

So - I cracked open Fusion360 and built the following design.

![Cross section view](/images/posts/2017/10/cross-section.png)

The bearing is just a press fit on the plug of the base and into the space in the top. The bearing is a standard 8mm high, 8mm inner diameter, 22mm outer diameter (the same as was used for most of the fidget spinners out there).

The STL files are based on an inner diameter of 8.05m and an outer diameter of 21.95mm because that's what works as a press fit when printed on my wanhao i3 plus.

Printed at 0.3mm layer height for speed (not too worried about the resolution of the print for this one - it's supposed to be a practical item).

Some photos:

It spins fine. I will put a masking tape layer on the top when using it to avoid it getting all covered in glue/paint over time.
