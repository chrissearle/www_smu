intro: How many parts do you need to print to make a dalek?
---

I picked up the transparent (or natural) filament today - so I could print off the light covers (ears).

That means all parts from the model are now printed.

I can now position the lower main body parts so that you can see from the base up to the lower point of the neck (that's as far as you can balance without glue).

## Next steps - assembly

Now I need to figure out what to use as a filler before sanding. Need to find a norwegian shop with some kind of plastic primer/filler rathern than just plastic primer.

Once that's done - I can prepare a primer coat (will be grey for most parts - black for the neck inserts and other parts that will be black when done).

Final paint coat (colours) will then go on top of that.

Not sure at what point I will assemble - some parts will be easier to paint separate, some will get a better merging painted in assembled position.

## Next steps - other stuff

I think a simple circuit will allow for controlling the LED flashes with sound (a basic NPN transistor + resistor deal).

How to get sound in there - right now I'm thinking of a cheap bluetooth sound module and a speaker - and then an app on my phone to send sound over bluetooth - this may just be adding dalek sounds to my music library :)
