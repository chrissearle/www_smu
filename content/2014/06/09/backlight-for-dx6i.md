Just added a backlight to the DX6i radio.

For [instructions see this helifreak post](http://www.helifreak.com/showthread.php?p=3238225)

Part used: [Turnigy 9X LCD Backlight Kit - Blue](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/uh_viewItem.asp?idProduct=16720)

## Issues

Was it hard? No. Just follow step by step.

Did anything go wrong? Not while doing this. Just before I dropped the damn radio and broke off the gear switch (_sigh_) but that was just me being clumsy :(
