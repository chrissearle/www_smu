intro: First photo assignment from dedpxl is lines

[First photo assignment](http://dedpxl.com/assignment-01-lines/) from [dedpxl](http://dedpxl.com) (Zack Arias) is lines.

I like the composition here - we get the power lines themselves running parallel to the hills behind - yet the sunbeams come in with a completely contrary direction.
