I've been wondering how best to attach my FPV screen to my phantom radio. I've tried the type that attaches to the bar across the back - but they make the kit large and unwieldy. I'd thought to attach it to the lanyard clip mount - but then a couple of times on facebook I saw this mod. It's easy to do, attaches easily - yet detaches easily for packing.

First we need to modify a gopro mount piece so that we can screw it to the screen's tripod mount. This is simply removing two of three plastic arms - and widening the hole in the remaining arm so that the screw goes through.

Then - the back of the screen (Bronto 7" FPV for fatshark/immersion) has a metal channel - it needs widening slightly so that we can insert the gopro piece. Dremel work.

Next just push the gopro piece in place.

And screw it fast.

Add a gopro j-clip.

And then use a standard gopro flat mount to attach it to the radio for use.

For packing/travel - you can now simply unclip the entire screen.

The battery for it (I just use one of my 3S lipo's) I attach behind using a battery strap.
