I needed some different/colourful images for the newly decorated loo wall :)

So - I picked up a recommendation for [waterlogue app](http://www.waterlogueapp.com/). Fun app - and surprisingly interesting results.

Here's the set of images I ended up with:

Finally one I didn't use as it was in black and white - from the trip home - Penzance station.

So - I printed these out on heavyweight canvas (Canson Infinity PhotoArt HD Canvas 400) and framed them in 4 frames - each with three images.

And then - just a couple of quick iPhone shots showing them in place:
