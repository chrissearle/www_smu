intro: Testing the F550 naza build near Gan

After spending time this summer building a naza based F550 hex - I haven't had much time to fly apart from quick tests in the garden.

This weekend we were out in the Gan area (Fetsund) and I took the hex along.

The craft flies very well. It's responsive to the controls and stable. The DJI low voltage alarm triggered quite quickly - but given that on landing I found about 3.9v per cell - I need to tweak that setting. In fact - I suspect I will turn it off - I have voltage telemetry on the radio - if I can get that to trigger an alarm on the radio then I don't need the DJI LED to flash red - I can't see it from the ground anyway.
