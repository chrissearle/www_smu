While visiting the UK for Christmas this year - we took a trip to see the Kew Gardens Christmas Lights walk together with dad and my brother and his family.

While waiting in the car park for the second car - I was able to take this shot of the Thames - this is from the Kew Gardens car park at Brentwood Gate:

We then headed into the park for the walk.

One favourite is the lit palm house:
