intro: On Gaustadjordet with P and the Summit and Vorza
---

Headed out to Gaustadjordet with P and the Summit and Vorza.

Fun - the summit is better on the snow of course - but there's just enough ice free for the vorza too.

Lost two of the snow chains at the end (switched to 2x3s and gave the summit a bashing) - found part of one of them - so I'll have to do some replacements for next year.

Vorza got a little dirty :) In fact both needed hosing down when we got home.
