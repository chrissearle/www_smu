intro: First time flying down at Svarterud stables
---

Took the F550 out for it's first spin since April (I really do need to find more time for it).

We were at Svarterud GÃ¥rd (farm) where the stables the wife and kids ride at is located.

### Issues

- Missed out on one recording - I probably didn't start the gopro properly
- The gimbal sometimes resets while flying - I believe this is because I have an ND filter on with no compensating weights to balance it
- Short flight times. My fault - had a very very conservative alarm on the radio (it receives the battery level from the F550). Adjusted for next time
- I still need more practice on smooth yawing
- No flight logs on flytrex yet - the SIM card seems to have been blocked. Working on both unblocking and also getting the missing missions to upload

A small photo of the F550 as it currently looks (video TX is hidden - hangs down at the back)
