Down at the stables again today - and once the kids had ridden - I wanted to try to fly. Last weekend it was too windy.

This weekend - it was also pretty windy - so much so that I only flew one battery (but that's also related to the kids wanting to head home).

Decided to see what it's like trying to film a moving target - this time the tractor sowing barley.

Didn't dare go too close - it was really windy and the inspire was bucking a bit in the wind - but - it did a real job of keeping the gimbal steady - the film came out pretty stable even though the craft was bouncing around up there.
