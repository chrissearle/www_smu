So - this holiday in addition to normal presents for the kids and since I was going to be at home with them for some days while my wife was at work I grabbed [Anki Overdrive](https://anki.com/en-us/overdrive) as a "something to do when the kids get bored".

It's turned out to be a success so far :)

But - car tracks, lit cars, cameras - something was calling out to be photographed.

The first two shots are taken using just the starter kit and the collision kit. They use all four cars in a race - and are for about 30 seconds. The squiggles are where cars have left the track.

Then today - the other two parts of the order that were originally out of stock arrived - an extra corner kit and the launch kit (jump). Here we also used some of the elevation and bank kit parts to raise the tracks in a bridge and in a bank. I'd also worked out how to switch the cars into demo mode to get more varied light effects from them as well as reduced the exposure time - so they're a little less busy.

All in all - a fun game, the kids enjoy it - and I'm also enjoying taking these photos too :)
