The last two nights I've been testing the Sky-Watcher Star Adventure star tracking tripod head.

The first evening - I was testing it for wide sky landscape shots.

The following shot was taken using 10x 2 minute shots stacked with Starry Landscape Stacker and then photoshop to merge in an unblurred foreground. There is a fair amount of light pollution - unavoidable here sadly - but if you look closely you can faintly see the Milky Way arcing across from left centre down behind the foreground front and centre.

The second evening - I decided to test something further away. This is Messier-101 - the [Pinwheel Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinwheel_Galaxy). This is 400x 10 second shots at 400mm f/5,6 (which is as wide as my 100-400 will go at the 400 end).

Stacked using Starry Sky Stacker, then levels adjust etc in photoshop.
