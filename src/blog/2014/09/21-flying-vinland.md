Flying near Vinland (Gan).

Testing a new 9000mah battery (extended life vs. extra weight) but didn't get to find out. About 6 mins in - the OSD info stopped updating position and then as I brought it in to land - about 3m up - as it was descending - it suddenly flew hard throttle right hitting hard enough to crack one leg (easily fixable) and also throwing the battery out - it's OK - but I don't know what battery life I would have had if I'd flown until I hit 15v (I've chosen 15v under load as my alarm point). Apart from the leg - it all seems fine but I do wonder why it suddenly lost position signal - it had 12 sat's showing on the OSD just before.
