Printing progress. Lots more parts printed. I have run out of blue so some are red. I've also run out of red - so the skirts will be in black. All that leaves now is the ears - they need to be in clear - and I need to get some clear filament for those (they will not be painted and need to have LEDs inside).

## The neck

First up is the neck.

This is built up of three rings, four inside inserts and 8 slats that the rings sit on.

The assembly here is that the inserts go inside the rings, the rings are glued to the small stubs on the slats.

Here's a picture with only the bottom ring in place to give an idea.

## Random parts

With the last of the blue - some random parts.

From the top left:

* the globe shape is the pivot for the arm where it goes inside the shoulder
* the thin square and thin circle are decals to go onto the shoulder part where the arms come out
* the thick round part is the pivot for the eye
* the big part bottom left is the bottom of the gun
* the small circle bottom middle is part of the tip of the gun
* the small circle bottom right goes right behind the plunger on the arm.

Now we switch to the red - to get the plunger end and the eye (two parts).

## Shoulders

Now we switch to the red. The shoulders hold the arm/gun and also have some slats on the outside for design.

The slats that go outside the shoulders are formed to match. They are layed out in the print file in the correct order. But that means that they are standing on their ends - not easy to get good bed adhesion - so this is the first time I've used a brim instead of a skirt (a raft seemed overkill). They all held in place - so that worked.

## The dome

Finally - we have the dome. This has two parts so far - the dome itself and the cowl.

I'm not happy with the cowl - it has no flat face to put onto the build plate - and even though it printed OK with supports - the corners are not great. I may either do a larger filling/sanding job here - or I might cut it into smaller parts in meshmixer and print/glue them. Not sure yet.

## Still to do

### Parts

Currently the skirts are printing (in black). I still need to do the light holders (ears?) - but for that I need to get some transparent filament. Finally I need to do the metal rods (eye, gun, arm) - not sure what to use for that yet - as well as the transparent rings halfway along the eye rod.

### Painting

The entire thing needs filling, sanding, primer and painting - I will be using something similar to [this colour scheme](http://www.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/dalek/types/19-time-war-daleks/).

### Assembly

Glue. Superglue. Hopefully not too much on my fingers.

### After that?

LEDs for the lights - synced to flash with sound and a dim blue led in the eye.
