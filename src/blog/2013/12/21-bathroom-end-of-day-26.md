Bath silicone done.

Doorframe painted and silicone along edges where it meets tiles.

Mirror in place - glue still drying so can't fill the crack around the edge just yet.

All finishing touches will be taken when the new window and the towel cupboard arrive - both have a delivery mid January. Glass shower panel will be fitted about the same time between the bath and the sink (has to wait on the window).
