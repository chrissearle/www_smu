Weekend over (no work) and today the floor heating cables have been put down and the cement (or whatever the mix is - special bathroom cement stuff to go above the heating cables and on which the tiles will be placed) has been poured. I don't know how long it needs to dry before they can continue - so I'm not sure what'll happen tomorrow.
