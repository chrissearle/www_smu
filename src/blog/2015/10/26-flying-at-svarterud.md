Took the F550 out for it's first spin since April (I really do need to find more time for it).

We were at Svarterud Gård (farm) where the stables the wife and kids ride at is located.

### Issues

- Missed out on one recording - I probably didn't start the gopro properly
- The gimbal sometimes resets while flying - I believe this is because I have an ND filter on with no compensating weights to balance it
- Short flight times. My fault - had a very very conservative alarm on the radio (it receives the battery level from the F550). Adjusted for next time
- I still need more practice on smooth yawing
- No flight logs on flytrex yet - the SIM card seems to have been blocked. Working on both unblocking and also getting the missing missions to upload

A small photo of the F550 as it currently looks (video TX is hidden - hangs down at the back)
