Summer holidays are here and we'd promised the kids an overnight camping trip as part of them.

We decided to head to Øyungen - it's about 2,5km uphill from the nearest bus stop - Skar - at the top of Maridalen. We'd been there before with them and know several good places to set up the tent - so we headed off.

## Wednesday

Usually we walk up the west side of the river - but - we'd decided to pick up some geocaches en route - so we headed up the east side instead. It's supposed to be prettier - and I think that it actually is.

The river itself has a fair number of old timber sections:

On the way up we picked up [GC1TD77 - The Gun Powder Mill](http://coord.info/GC1TD77) and [GCWF7P - Afghani River](http://coord.info/GCWF7P) geocaches. I found GC1TD77, P found GCWF7P.

Once we arrived at the lake - we could see the dam - last time we were here this was being repaired.

Once we'd set up camp - we decided that I'd take the kids up the top of the nearby hill to grab a couple more geocaches and to see the views. It's quite a steep climb - lots of rocks but the views are worth it.

First up was [GCWCC1 - Fly like an...](http://coord.info/GCWCC1). E spotted this one.

This is a really unusual cache container - and the views are good.

Then off to the top of the hill to grab [GCJE95 - Bernhard #26: Misty Mountains](http://coord.info/GCJE95). I found this one - and inside we were able to log [Button/Pin bag](http://coord.info/TB2T0G1) trackable. We didn't take it with us - but the kids were interested to see it.

The views from the top are spectacular.

Back down to A and the tent for dinner. Øyungen is a nice place in the evenings - although there's a fair amount of insects. The fish are really active - jumping up to grab the mayflies.

## Thursday

Heading home after a leisurely start to the day - we took the west path down along Skarselva - picking up the only geocache of the day - [GC19EZF - The (de)fences are falling](http://coord.info/GC19EZF). Again - honours for this one are mine :)

Then down to the bus stop - made it with about 5 minutes to spare (hourly bus route) and then home.
