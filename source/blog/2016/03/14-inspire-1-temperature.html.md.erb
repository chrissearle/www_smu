I send my flight data to [flytrex](http://www.flytrex.com/) while flying, and I also upload the flight records to [healthy drones](https://healthydrones.com/) afterwards.

Both show a graph of temperature over time. Healthy drones explicitly shows it as battery temperature, flytrex just temperature.

But - they are not consistent.

I need to find out why the difference. How many temperature sensors does an Inspire have? If only one then why two different graphs? If more than one - what does each measure?
