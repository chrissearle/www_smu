Trying out the new Inspire 1 rig - so flying again at the stables. Flew one battery of two - fingers got too cold to fly the second.

Note to remember:

* When charging your iPad - remember to take it with you

No fancy stuff yet - didn't go higher than 40m, didn't try the special flight modes or [Autopilot](https://autoflightlogic.com/autopilot) app - still getting used to the feel of it.

It's very very responsive and extremely stable in the air.

Used the ND filter - so some of the early shots are a bit dark - but later on it was better with it. Hard to judge - will get better at that with practice.
