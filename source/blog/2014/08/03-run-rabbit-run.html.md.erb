We recently took over two female angora rabbits - while we were on holiday, they've had two weeks at the summer hut. Now we're back home and will need to leave them unattended - they need a run.

On Thursday evening I took a trip to Maxbo and purchased the wood (untreated in case the rabbits gnaw on it) and some plastic roofing plates - colour is called soot - hopefully it will provide some shade while still letting some light in.

On Friday - we started with building the frame:

<%= fancybox_image("Frame_1.jpg", "Frame built") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Frame_2.jpg", "Frame built") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Roof_1.jpg", "Roof added") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Roof_2.jpg", "Roof added") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Door.jpg", "Door in place") %>

The white box in the background is for garden chair cushions but it's neither waterproof or mouse proof - so we're repurposing it as a bedroom for the rabbits. It will be joined with a short tunnel and can be properly insulated for winter - something the hutch can't be.

I'd intended to have enough netting in from the base to prevent the rabbits from digging out - but on Thursday evening while I was sitting in the garden a badger came round the corner of the garage. They're excellent diggers - so we needed a more robust base. But I didn't want the rabbits to have to sit on the wire mesh.

So the next stage was removing the turf:

<%= fancybox_image("Turf_removed.jpg", "Turf removed") %>

Now - finding fox proof netting turned out to be hard. In the end - we found a website for a firm based in Ramnes (near TÃ¸nsberg) [D. Johansen Husdyrutstyr](http://www.djohansenhusdyrutstyr.no/) who had galvanised netting with a 1" square grid - 1.2m high, 25m long and with 1,75mm thick wire. To top it off - they were doing a free delivery run around the region on Sunday. Perfect size, grid, thickness an d timing.

Big heavy roll though.

<%= fancybox_image("Base_made.jpg", "Netting base made") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Base_placed.jpg", "Base placed") %>

Now we had to finish the ground preparation.

<%= fancybox_image("Replacing_turf.jpg", "Placing the turf back in place") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Turf_replaced.jpg", "Turf replaced. You can also see the door added to the white box in the background") %>

Next the frame was moved back into place and the netting along the bottom fastened to it.

<%= fancybox_image("Run_placed_on_base_1.jpg", "Frame placed inside ground grid") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Run_placed_on_base_2.jpg", "Frame placed inside ground grid") %>

Now came the walls.

<%= fancybox_image("Start_of_wall_netting.jpg", "Start of hanging the wall netting") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Walls_in_progress.jpg", "Wall netting in progress from the inside") %>

So - we got the walls and door done.

<%= fancybox_image("Walls_and_door_complete.jpg", "Walls and door complete") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Not_a_rabbit.jpg", "Not a rabbit") %>

And finally we moved the rabbits in.

<%= fancybox_image("Moved_in_1.jpg", "Rabbits moved in") %>
<%= fancybox_image("Moved_in_2.jpg", "Rabbits moved in") %>

What's left to do now? Well - we still need to make the tunnel to the white box/bedroom, add a hook in the inside of the door so that you can keep the door closed while inside - but otherwise - pretty much done.
