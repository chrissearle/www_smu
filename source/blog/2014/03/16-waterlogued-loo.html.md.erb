I needed some different/colourful images for the newly decorated loo wall :)

So - I picked up a recommendation for [waterlogue app](http://www.waterlogueapp.com/). Fun app - and surprisingly interesting results.

Here's the set of images I ended up with:

<%= fancybox_image("association-boats.jpg", "Association Boats - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("boats-in-the-bay.jpg", "Boats in the bay - view from the quay - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("bryher-from-tresco.jpg", "View from King Charles Castle over to Bryher showing Cromwell's Castle - Tresco") %>

<%= fancybox_image("great-bay.jpg", "Great Bay - St. Martins") %>

<%= fancybox_image("puffins1.jpg", "Puffins on the water") %>

<%= fancybox_image("puffins2.jpg", "Puffins on the water") %>

<%= fancybox_image("pulpit-rock.jpg", "Pulpit Rock - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("rock-on-agnes.jpg", "A strange rock formation - St. Agnes") %>

<%= fancybox_image("rock-piles-bryher.jpg", "Small stones piled on wooden poles - Bryher") %>

<%= fancybox_image("sunset-from-thomas-porth.jpg", "Sunset from Thomas Porth - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("sunset-over-samson.jpg", "Sunset over Samson - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("sunset-over-thomas-porth.jpg", "Sunset over Thomas Porth - St. Marys") %>

<%= fancybox_image("view-from-buzza.jpg", "View from Buzza - St. Marys") %>


Finally one I didn't use as it was in black and white - from the trip home - Penzance station.

<%= fancybox_image("penzance.jpg", "Penzance Station") %>

So - I printed these out on heavyweight canvas (Canson Infinity PhotoArt HD Canvas 400) and framed them in 4 frames - each with three images.

And then - just a couple of quick iPhone shots showing them in place:

<%= fancybox_image("pics1.jpg", "Framed Pics") %>

<%= fancybox_image("pics2.jpg", "Framed Pics") %>
