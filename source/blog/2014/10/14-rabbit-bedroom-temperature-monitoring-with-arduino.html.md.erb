So - we've insulated the sleeping room (originally a garden cushion box) for the rabbits and mounted a heating panel that should keep it between 12˚C and 15˚C. But we need to keep an eye on it.

I could just get a cheap thermometer with remote unit from a hardware store - but how to check how the temperature varies over time?

Let's play with an arduino instead :)

I started with [this tutorial from raywenderlich.com](http://www.raywenderlich.com/38841/arduino-tutorial-temperature-sensor). It's using OneWire temperature sensors called DS18B20. I'm also going to use an ethernet connection with PoE to avoid having to have a separate power supply to the board.

I also modified the code by grabbing the latest onewire and dallas libraries and changed the output from JSON to a format that it is easy to write a munin script around.

The circuit I have ended up with is:

And breadboarded for testing it looks like:

### Components

* Arduino Uno
* Arduino Ethernet Shield with PoE
* 2x DS18B20 (I chose [these pre-cabled waterproofed ones](http://www.youblob.com/shop/products/electronics/sensors/temperature/SEN-11050) to save time and make mounting easier)
* 2x 4k7Ω resistors
* 1x 330Ω resistor
* 1 LED

### Code

It's all [on github](https://github.com/chrissearle/rabbit-temperatures)
