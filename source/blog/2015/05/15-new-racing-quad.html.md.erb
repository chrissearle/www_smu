Finally did most of the build on the new FPV racing quad.

Initial information was covered in [this blog post](http://www.searle.me.uk/2015/04/21/racing-250-frame-change/)

Controller - naze32 - with cleanflight firmware - working very well.

One of the frame switches on the PDB board is used for the FPV gear - so that can be turned on or off.

I will be adding some LEDs under (WS2812 controllable LEDs) so that I can see status from a distance.
