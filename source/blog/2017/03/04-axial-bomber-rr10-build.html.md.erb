So although I have a couple of basher trucks and one high speed buggy - I didn't
have a good slow/powerful rock climber truck.

After digging thru a fair number of sites - I decided that the Axial RR10
looked like a fun build. I decided to grab the kit version since it has a fair
number of upgrades over the RTR version.

It also means that you learn how the car goes together as you build it (handy for
repairs etc later on) and would be a challenge - I've not done much RC lexan
painting apart from a single colour job on my son's CC-01 unimog.

I've thrown an axial 55 turn motor in (I don't need a rock racer - can use 
existing cars for that), the axial ae-5 controller and a futaba 3PL radio.

The build came together well - and I think I managed to do an OK job for the first
time doing a multi-colour paint job.

I learned a fair bit of technique from watching [hemistorm](https://www.youtube.com/user/hemistormrc)
on youtube. Decided to go with liquid based masking rather than tape and used
the blue/yellow icon that I use most places as a starting point.

Happy enough with it - it was fairly complex layering but it was pretty easy
to use the mask - apart from when I got the paint too thick - that had a tendency
to stretch when removing a mask section.

The inside part also came out OK I think - it's the only part where I used the
supplied decals - but it's also painted.

Now all I want is better weather - time to test it outside rather than in the lounge :)
