Found [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:39085) of a star decoration on Thingiverse.

Did a quick print run and instead of using a string of LED lights just grabbed a handful from the drawer and a small buck converter (I could have used resistors but the current draw was a little high for the &frac14; watt ones I have - and I didn't want to have to make a large cluster of resistors to get the right dissipation/resistance).

The USB cable was an old 30pin apple USB cable - which we don't use any more and which had frayed near to the 30pin connector.

The result:
