    description: 'Testing drone deploy and altizure with DJI Mavic. Had some issues with camera focus so need to test again'
---

Testing some of the mapping and 3d/photogrammetry apps out there with the mavic yesterday.

Had some issues with the mavic's camera focus (was out of focus even when pre-set) so I'll need to try again.

But - two maps with drone deploy and one 3d model with altizure.

The drone deploy maps were very affected by the focus error - the altizure model slightly less.

All of these should support click/drag/zoom/pan etc.
