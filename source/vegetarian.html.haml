%h1 Vegetarian

  I've been vegetarian for about
  = (Time.now.year - Time.new(1973, 07, 28).year) - 18
  years now - but what does that mean?

    It means I do not eat the following:

  %ul.list-group
    %li.list-group-item Meat
    %li.list-group-item Fish
    %li.list-group-item Shellfish

    I am not vegan - so I do eat:
    
  %ul.list-group
    %li.list-group-item Cheese
    %li.list-group-item Egg
    %li.list-group-item Milk
    %li.list-group-item Dairy

    But there are a couple of things to be careful about.

  %p
    %span.label.label-danger= 'Gelatine'
    is a product that comes from pigs. It is used in many products with a jelly like consistency.
    Alternatives include pectin and agar agar - but you have to check the ingredients to know.

  %p
    %span.label.label-danger= 'Rennet'
    comes from cows and is used in lots of cheeses to harden them. There is a vegetarian form called microbial rennet. Sadly,
    Tine use cow rennet in nearly all their yellow cheeses and therefore almost all Tine yellow cheese is not vegetarian. Synn√∏ve Finden and
    some other companies are often OK - again - you have to check the ingredients to know.

    One last comment.

    No - vegetarians can't just "pick the meat off" or anything similar. Imagine a sauce that you simply can't stand - that's soaked into
    the dish - and you get told "can't you just scrape it off ?" You know that you'll never get it completely off,
    well, for us it's the same with meat/fish/etc. It shouldn't even be on the same serving dish.
